## Introduction

Event Subscriptions in Infisical allow you to receive real-time notifications when specific actions occur within your account or organization. These notifications can include changes to secrets, users, teams, and other important resources.

You can currently subscribe to notifications for the following event types:

### Supported Event Types

- `secret:created`: Triggered when a secret is created.
- `secret:updated`: Triggered when a secret is updated.
- `secret:deleted`: Triggered when a secret is deleted.
