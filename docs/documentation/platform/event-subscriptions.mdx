## Introduction

Event Subscriptions in Infisical let you receive real-time notifications when specific actions take place within your account or organization. These can include changes to secrets, users, teams, and other important resources.

Currently, you can subscribe to notifications for the following event types:

### Supported Event Types

- `secret:created`: Triggered when a secret is created.
- `secret:updated`: Triggered when a secret is updated.
- `secret:deleted`: Triggered when a secret is deleted.
