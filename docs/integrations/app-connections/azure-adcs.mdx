    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure Connection Details">
      **Configuration Tab:**
    - **Name**: Friendly name for this ADCS connection (e.g., "Production ADCS")
    - **ADCS URL**: Your ADCS HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://adcs.yourdomain.com/certsrv`) - only HTTPS is supported
    - **Username**: Domain administrator username (format: `DOMAIN\username` or `username@domain.com`)
    - **Password**: Password for the domain administrator account
    
    **SSL Tab:**
    - **SSL Certificate**: Optional PEM certificate for custom CA certificates or self-signed certificates
    - **Reject Unauthorized**: Whether to reject connections with invalid SSL certificates (it's recommended to keep it enabled)
    
    <Note>
    **Getting the SSL Certificate**: If your ADCS server uses a self-signed certificate or a certificate from a custom CA, you can obtain the certificate using OpenSSL:
    
    ```bash
    openssl s_client -connect your-adcs-server:443 -showcerts
    ```
    
    Copy the certificate content (including `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` lines) and paste it into the SSL Certificate field.
    </Note>

    And click **Connect to ADCS** to establish the connection.
