![Architecture Overview](../../../images/platform/gateways/gateway-highlevel-diagram.png)

The Infisical Gateway provides secure access to private resources within your network without needing direct inbound connections to your environment. This method keeps your resources fully protected from external access while enabling Infisical to securely interact with resources like databases.

<Info>
  Gateway is a paid feature available under the Enterprise Tier for Infisical
  Cloud users. Self-hosted Infisical users can contact
  [sales@infisical.com](mailto:sales@infisical.com) to purchase an enterprise

## What are Gateways and Relays?

### Gateway

A lightweight service deployed within your VPCs that provides secure access to private resources:

- **Runs inside your network** - Deployed within your VPCs, data centers, or on-premises infrastructure
- **Makes outbound connections only** - No inbound firewall rules required
- **Provides secure access** - Uses SSH reverse tunnels and certificate-based authentication
- **Handles resource connections** - Connects to your private databases, APIs, and services

### Relay Server

Infrastructure that routes encrypted traffic between the Infisical platform and gateways:

- **Routes encrypted traffic** - Routes traffic between the platform and gateways
- **Provides network isolation** - Enables communication without direct connections
- **Handles authentication** - Manages SSH certificate validation and routing
- **Ensures security** - Uses double encryption to protect data in transit

## How It Works

The Gateway system uses SSH reverse tunnels for secure, firewall-friendly connectivity:

1. **Gateway Registration**: The gateway establishes an outbound SSH reverse tunnel to a relay server using SSH certificates issued by Infisical
2. **Relay Routing**: The relay server routes encrypted traffic between the Infisical platform and gateways
3. **Resource Access**: The Infisical platform connects to your private resources through the established gateway connections

**Key Benefits:**

- **No inbound firewall rules needed** - all connections are outbound from your network
- **Firewall-friendly** - uses standard SSH over TCP
- **Certificate-based authentication** provides enhanced security
- **Automatic reconnection** if connections are lost

## Understanding Relay Types

Relays are the routing infrastructure that enables secure communication between Infisical and your gateways. There are two main approaches to relay deployment:

**Managed Relays** - Use Infisical's hosted relay infrastructure in US/EU regions for quick setup with minimal operational overhead.

**Self-Deployed Relays** - Deploy your own relay servers for regional proximity, enhanced control, and custom network policies.

### Managed Relays (Recommended for Most Users)

Managed relays are pre-configured relay servers hosted by Infisical that can serve multiple organizations with minimal operational overhead.

**Infisical Cloud (US/EU Regions):**

- Pre-configured relays in US and EU regions
- No setup or maintenance required
- Shared across all Infisical Cloud organizations
- Managed and monitored by Infisical
- Best for getting started quickly

**Self-Hosted Instance Relays:**

- Instance administrators can deploy shared relays for their entire instance
- All organizations on the instance can use these relays
- Reduces operational burden for individual Organizations
- Ideal for self-hosted instances wanting shared relay infrastructure

### Self-Deployed Relays (Organization-Specific)

Organizations can deploy and manage their own dedicated relay servers for regional proximity, network control, compliance requirements, or enhanced security.

**Key Benefits:**

- Deploy in any region or cloud provider for lower latency
- Custom network configurations and security policies
- Dedicated resources not shared with other organizations
- Full control over relay infrastructure
- Uses standard Infisical authentication methods
